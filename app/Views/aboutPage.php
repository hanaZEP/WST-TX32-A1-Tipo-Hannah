                    <p class="about-description text-dark">Established on February 26, 1941, Philippine Airlines (PAL) is the Philippines' first commercial airline. Our journey began with a flight from Manila to Baguio, and since then, we have dedicated ourselves to connecting Filipinos around the globe.</p>
                    <p class="about-description text-dark">In 1946, PAL inaugurated its first international route to San Francisco, setting the stage for our expansion into a global network. Over the years, we've grown to connect travelers to major destinations across Asia, North America, Europe, and the Middle East.</p>
                    <p class="about-description text-dark">In 2009, we launched PAL Express, a low-cost subsidiary designed to enhance domestic travel and promote tourism within the Philippines. With a modern fleet and strategic alliances, PAL is a leader in the aviation sector.</p>
                    <p class="about-description text-dark">Philippine Airlines is committed to sustainability and has invested significantly in modernizing our fleet with fuel-efficient aircraft, reflecting our dedication to minimizing environmental impact.</p>
